Hello {bc_first_name},

Thank you once more for all your hard work as a block captain. We have already seen the results of our efforts, and we are ready to make one final push to turn Florida blue!  


Your List Vitals:

The attached list is of those voters in your turf that have not voted as of the week of October 27th. These are likely to be either voters who are waiting until Election Day, or who may need help or information to vote. It is crucial that we reach out to this remaining bloc of likely Democratic voters.

Here is your list number for MiniVAN: {list_number}
